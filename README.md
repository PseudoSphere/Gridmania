UI to facilitate Picks and Bans for my new game/mode Gridmania.

Start with a possible 9 games:
3 Checkers,
3 Chess,
3 Go

Taking one action at a time, each player bans a total of 2 games each then picks the order of the remaining games to be played in a best of 5.

---
**Example**  
Bans:
P1 Checkers,
P2 Chess,
P1 Go,
P2 Chess

Picks:
P1: Go,
P2: Checkers,
P1: Go,
P2: Checkers,
P1: Chess

This would result in a Bo5: Go -> Checkers -> Go -> Checkers -> Chess
